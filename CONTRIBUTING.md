# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are welcome, provided that hey follow this guidelines.


## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE


### With a new Issue

If you have a new issue to report, please create it [here](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker/elixir/elixir/issues/new) and please follow [this guidelines](#issues-guidelines).


### In a Current Issue

Browse the [current open issues](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker/elixir/elixir/issues) and participate in the
discussion for the ones you can help.

### Solving an Issue

In case you also want to work on the solution for it, please discuss how you want to proceed.

After an agreement is achieved the issue will be assigned to you.

Now is time to fork the repository and start coding on it.

When you are ready to merge it, please proceed as per this [Merge Requests Guidelines](docs/how-to/create_a_merge_request.md).


## ISSUES GUIDELINES

Always perform a search to see if your Issue as been already reported.


### Generic Guidelines

Issues must use one of the available templates and all topics marked as required must be filled, by erasing the current
help and example info on them and write your own text.

All optional topics not used must maintain their title and have their body replaced by 'N/A'.

When any created issue do not follow this guidelines it will not be considered.

Each issue will have is own Branch that are created as demonstrated [here](create_branches.md).


### Bug Fix / Security Fix

Each issue should only target a specific bug or security flaw, unless they are tightly coupled to the point you can't
solve them separately.

Create the issue [here](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker/elixir/elixir/issues/new) with the template
`bug_or_security_fix.md`.


### New Feature / Improve Feature / Refracting Code

Starts with the [Creation of a Milestone](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker/elixir/elixir/milestones/new).

Now we should split what we want to do in many tasks as we can by creating an Issue for each task and assign the issue
to the Milestone.

Create each issue [here](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker/elixir/elixir/issues/new) using the relevant template:

* `new_feature.md`
* `improve_feature.md`
* `refracting_code.md`
* `bug_or_security_fix.md`


## MERGE REQUEST GUIDELINES

When opening your Merge Request ensure to do it against the `master` branch.

Merge requests must use one of the available templates and all topics marked as `required` must be filled.

All optional topics not used must maintain their title and have their body replaced by 'N/A'.
