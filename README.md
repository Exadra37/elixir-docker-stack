## QUICK START

### Install

Clone the project somewhere in your computer:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker/elixir/elixir-docker-stack.git
```

Now we need to set where you have installed the **Elixir Docker Stack**:

```bash
export ELIXIR_DOCKER_STACK_INSTALL_DIR="${PWD}/elixir-docker-stack"
```

Time to build the docker image for the **Elixir Docker Stack**:

```bash
elixir build debian
```

Let's do some smoke tests:

```bash
$ elixir --version
Erlang/OTP 21 [erts-10.3.4] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [ds:4:4:10] [async-threads:1] [hipe]

Elixir 1.8.1 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 21)

$ mix phx.new --version
Phoenix v1.4.3
```

Seems that we have a working **Elixir Docker Stack** :).


### Creating a New Phoenix App

Following along the official [Up and Running](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/up_and_running.html) for the Phoenix framework.

Creating a new Phoenix app:

```bash
mix phx.new hello
```

Now we need to get inside the directory for the `hello` app:

```bash
cd hello
```

Let's create the database for the `hello` app:

```bash
mix ecto.create
```

Time to start the Phoenix server:

```bash
mix phx.server
```

The `hello` app is now running on http://localhost:4000.

## EXPLICIT VERSIONING

This repository uses [Explicit Versioning](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-versioning/explicit-versioning) schema.


## BRANCHES

Branches are created as demonstrated [here](docs/how-to/create_branches.md).

This are the type of branches we can see at any moment in the repository:

* `master` - issues and milestones branches will be merged here. Don't use it in
              production.
* `last-stable-release` - matches the last stable tag created. Useful for
                           automation tools. Doesn't guarantee backwards
                           compatibility.
* `4-fix-some-bug` - each issue will have is own branch for development.
* `milestone-12_add-some-new-feature` - all Milestone issues will start, tracked and merged
                             here.

Only `master` and `last-stable-release` branches will be permanent ones in the
repository and all other ones will be removed once they are merged.


## DISCLAIMER

I code for passion and when coding I like to do as it pleases me...

You know I do this in my free time, thus I want to have fun and enjoy it ;).

Professionally I will do it as per company guidelines and standards.
