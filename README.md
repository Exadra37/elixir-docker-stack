## EXPLICIT VERSIONING

This repository uses [Explicit Versioning](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-versioning/explicit-versioning) schema.


## BRANCHES

Branches are created as demonstrated [here](docs/how-to/create_branches.md).

This are the type of branches we can see at any moment in the repository:

* `master` - issues and milestones branches will be merged here. Don't use it in
              production.
* `last-stable-release` - matches the last stable tag created. Useful for
                           automation tools. Doesn't guarantee backwards
                           compatibility.
* `4-fix-some-bug` - each issue will have is own branch for development.
* `milestone-12_add-some-new-feature` - all Milestone issues will start, tracked and merged
                             here.

Only `master` and `last-stable-release` branches will be permanent ones in the
repository and all other ones will be removed once they are merged.


## DISCLAIMER

I code for passion and when coding I like to do as it pleases me...

You know I do this in my free time, thus I want to have fun and enjoy it ;).

Professionally I will do it as per company guidelines and standards.
